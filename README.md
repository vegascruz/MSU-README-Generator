Description: 

This is a command-line application that will generate a professional README.md file based on user's input. 

Technology Used: 
    * VS.Code
    * JavaScript
    * Node.js
    * Inquirer
    * Powershell CMD

Issues:

I didn't run into a whole lot, had to really study Node.js to understand what the heck was going on... otherwise, once I figured that out. The inquirer documentation was very easy to understand. 

Things Learned:

SO MUCH. This is my first time working with node.js. creating/storing files and using inquirer to prompt the user in the console. I also learned how to share data across files.
