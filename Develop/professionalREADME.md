  ## Installation
  Simply go to the program link, clone the code to your computer, and run the program using node.js 

  ## Usage

  ## Motivation
  It will be very useful for when I need to create a good readme for future projects

  ## Why?
  It was for class, but I'm realizing this will be very handy for other programs

  ## Problem Solved?
  It cuts out the time spent on making a README.md and allows for more devotion into the actual program

  ## Things Learned
  SO MUCH. This is my first time working with node.js. creating/storing files and using inquirer to prompt the user in the console. I also learned how to share data across files. 

  ## Contributors

  ## Tests
  Open your command line, cd into the folder the program is stored on... make sure node js and inquirer are installed, then run the code using node index.js
